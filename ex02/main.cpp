	Difference btwn Dog dog; and AAnimal *mydog = new Dog();

	Dog dog;
	- creates a Dog object on the stack
	- The object dog is automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope,
	such as at the end of a function or block where it's declared.
	- The memory management is handled automatically by the system,
	which means you donâ€™t need to manually deallocate the memory.
	- If you want to use polymorphism (e.g., calling overridden methods from a base class pointer),
	this direct instantiation does not involve pointers or base class references.
	- automatic storage duration (handled by the compiler)

	AAnimal *mydog = new Dog();
	- creates a Dog object on the heap and assigns its address to a pointer of
	type AAnimal*
	- new = dynamically allocates memory for a Dog object and returns a pointer to it
	-  responsible for manually deallocating this memory using delete to avoid memory leaks
	- allows you to use polymorphism because mydog is a pointer to the base class AAnimal,
	but it actually points to a Dog object.
	- You can call virtual functions declared in AAnimal that may be overridden in Dog
	- dynamic storage duration (handled by delete)
